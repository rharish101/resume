\section*{Practical Experience}
\begin{itemize}

\item \begin{project}{Research Intern}{May '19 -- Jul '19}{\iffull{Prof.\ Pawe≈Ç Korus, Prof.\ Nasir Memon, }New York University}%chktex 8
    \item Researched \textbf{robust image hashes} that are immune to typical image transformations,\iffull{ measured by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming\_distance}{Hamming distances},} while being sensitive to malicious image edits such as face swaps,\iffull{ object addition/deletion,} \& deep fakes.
    \item Developed a framework for testing against\iffull{ transformations like} compression, contrast changes,\ifsingle{ gamma,} blurring, warping.
    \iffull{
        \item Trained models on the \href{https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1756042}{\textbf{triplet loss}} along with \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832}{mining} of examples for improved training.
        \item Tested networks against \textbf{adversarial attacks} like \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572}{FGSM}, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083}{Projected Gradient Descent}, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04248}{Boundary Attack}.
    }
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/Plasticity-Networks]{Research Intern (Remote)}{May '18 -- Jul '18}{\iffull{Prof.\ Yao Wang, }New York University}%chktex 8
    \item Researched \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02464}{differentiable plasticity} for \textbf{domain transfer} in images using convolutional neural networks.
    \item Simplified the temporal update rule for the Hebbian weights of convolutional layers.
    \iffull{
        \item Tested various ResNet-based architectures on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
        \item \textbf{Improved accuracy}\iffull{ for smaller models} using plasticity, when adapting models pre-trained on\ifsingle{ the} SVHN\ifsingle{ dataset} for MNIST.\@
    }
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}{Intern, Machine Learning Team}{May -- Jul, 2017 \& 2018}{NYC Office of IIT Kanpur}%chktex 8
    \item Developed an \textbf{online text clustering} model using a \href{https://github.com/cloudwalkio/ddbscan}{fully-online modification} of the DBSCAN algorithm.
    \iffull{
        \item Implemented an \textbf{online document vectorisation} model using \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4053}{Distributed Memory paragraph vectors}.
    }
    \item Developed a \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781}{Word2Vec} model to identify duplicate documents using \href{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kusnerb15.html}{Word Mover's Distance} on word vectors.
