\section*{Projects}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0mm]

\item \begin{project}{Deblurring by Synthesizing Blur}{Feb '21 -- Present}{Prof.\ Dr.\ Marc Pollefeys}%chktex 8
    \item Semester project to de-blur individual frames and generate `sub-frames', as if captured by a high-speed camera.
    \item Builds upon \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00595}{DeFMO}, which re-constructs sharp contours and time-varying appearance of fast moving objects.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}{Teaching GANs Interactively}{Jan '19 -- Aug '20}{Prof.\ Vinay Namboodiri, Prof.\ Chetan Arora}%chktex 8
    \item Researched \textit{human-in-the-loop mechanisms} for improving quality of \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661}{Generative Adversarial Networks}.
    \item Achieved efficient improvement in generation of sketches and digits on standard datasets.
    \item The user's interaction is used to obtain as well as to modify the latent space mapping as required.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09803]{CovidAID:\ COVID-19 Detection Using X-Rays}{Apr '20 -- Aug '20}{Prof.\ Vinay Namboodiri, Prof.\ Chetan Arora}%chktex 8
    \item Developed a \href{}{CheXNet}-based CNN model to classify chest X-rays with an Imbalance Ratio of 45.3:1 for COVID-19.
    \item Improved significantly upon the results of \href{https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR}{Covid-Net} with 90.5\% accuracy and 100\% recall for COVID-19.
    \item Researched \textit{multi-modal} models to use patient metadata.
\end{project}
