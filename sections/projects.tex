\section*{Projects}
\begin{itemize}

\item \begin{project}[https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rharish/ugp2]{Improving GANs through Test-Time Constraints}{Jan '19 - Present}{Prof. Vinay Namboodiri and Prof. Chetan Arora}
    \item Pre-trained GANs are fine-tuned during test time using \textit{interactive user input}, inspired by the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03552}{iGAN} paper and the paper \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09796}{Exploiting Test Time Evidence to Improve Predictions of Deep Neural Networks}.
    \item The user provides sketches of edges on a single output of the generator, and a \textit{difference-of-Gaussians} based loss is backpropagated through the generator to fine-tune the generator's weights.
    \item A regularisation term in the loss prevents the weights from deviating away from the originally learned weights.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rharish/ugp1]{Multi Agent GANs for Image Super Resolution}{Aug '18 - Dec '18}{Prof. Vinay Namboodiri}
    \item A \textit{Multi-agent generalisation} of \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802}{SRGAN} inspired by \href{http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers_backup/Ghosh_Multi-Agent_Diverse_Generative_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf}{MADGANs} for image super resolution in \textit{TensorFlow}.
    \item Four generators (with shared lower layers) are fed the four corner sections of the input (with a slight overlap), and their outputs are joined (negating the overlap) to get the final high-resolution image.
    \item Each generator has its own discriminator, along with a global discriminator for the final output.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/CS771-Project]{Higher Order Optimization in Deep Learning}{Sep '18 - Nov '18}{Prof. Piyush Rai, CS771A Course Project}
    \item A survey on the use of \textit{quasi-Newton methods} in deep learning as part of a course.
    \item \href{http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jmartens/docs/Deep_HessianFree.pdf}{\textit{Hessian-Free optimization}}, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01169}{\textit{AdaQN}}, and \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115}{\textit{Sum of Functions Optimizer (SFO)}} were surveyed.
    \item Hessian-Free optimization was tested on an MLP against the \textit{Adam} and SGD optimizers in \textit{TensorFlow} on Python.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/eye-in-the-sky]{7th Inter-IIT Tech Meet (Silver Medal)}{Dec '18}{IIT Kanpur Contingent}
    \item The Eye in the Sky: Semantic segmentation of satellite images using a dataset of only 14 images.
    \item Won \textit{2nd place} using the \href{http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10032237/7/David_08270673.pdf}{\textit{P-Net}} architecture, trained on an augmented dataset generated by slicing each image into multiple images and using rotations.
    \item Model hyperparameters were tuned using the \href{https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4443-algorithms-for-hyper-parameter-optimization}{\textit{Tree of Parzen Estimators}} method from the \href{https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/}{\textit{Hyperopt}} library.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/CS335A]{Compiler for Golang in Python}{Jan '19 - April '19}{Prof. Amey Karkare, CS335A Course Project}
    \item A compiler for translating Golang to MIPS written in Python as part of a course.
    \item Basic C-like features like datatypes, variables, expressions, control statements (if-else, switch, loops), arrays, functions, pointers, structs, library imports, and I/O implemented.
    \item Advanced features like composite literals, struct embeddings, typedefs/aliases, operator overloading, multiple value returns, multiple parallel assignments, short declarations, and short-circuit evaluation also implemented.
