    \iffull{
        \item A Convolutional Neural Network de-blurs individual frames as well as generates `sub-frames', as if captured by a high-speed camera (i.e.\ temporal super-resolution).
        \item Builds upon \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00595}{DeFMO},\iffull{ a generative model} which re-constructs sharp contours and time-varying complex appearance of FMOs\iffull{ that move over 3D trajectories with 3D rotation}.

        \item Developed a \href{}{CheXNet}-based CNN model to classify chest X-rays with an Imbalance Ratio of 45.3:1 for COVID-19.
        \item Improved significantly upon the results of \href{https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR}{Covid-Net} with \textbf{90.5\% accuracy and 100\% recall} for COVID-19.
        \item Researched \textbf{multi-modal} models that can leverage patient metadata to improve diagnosis.
    \end{project}

    \item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/UGP1/]{Multi-Agent GANs for Image Super-Resolution}{Aug '18 -- Dec '18}{Prof.\ Vinay Namboodiri}%chktex 8
        \item A \textbf{Multi-agent generalisation} of \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802}{SRGAN} inspired by \href{http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers_backup/Ghosh_Multi-Agent_Diverse_Generative_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf}{MADGANs} for image super-resolution in TensorFlow.
        \item Four generators (with shared lower layers) get the four corner sections of the input (with a slight overlap), and their outputs are joined (negating the overlap) to get the final high-resolution image.
        \item Each generator pairs with a discriminator, while a global discriminator acts on the final output.
