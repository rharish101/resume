\ifsingle{\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}}

\item \begin{project}{Research Intern, NYU Tandon}{May '19 -- July '19}{Prof.\ Pawe≈Ç Korus, Prof.\ Nasir Memon}%chktex 8
    \item Researched \textbf{robust image hashes} that are immune to typical image transformations,\iffull{ measured by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming\_distance}{Hamming distances},} while being sensitive to malicious image edits such as face swaps,\iffull{ object addition/deletion,} \& deep fakes.
    \item Developed a framework for testing against\iffull{ transformations like} compression, contrast changes,\ifsingle{ gamma,} blurring, warping.
    \iffull{\item Constructed various novel network architectures that analyse images in both the spatial and frequency domains.}
    \item Trained models on the \href{https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1756042}{\textbf{triplet loss}} along with \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832}{mining} of examples for improved training.
    \item Tested networks against \textbf{adversarial attacks} like \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572}{FGSM}, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083}{Projected Gradient Descent}, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04248}{Boundary Attack}.
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}[https://github.com/rharish101/Plasticity-Networks]{RTE Intern, NYU Tandon}{May '18 -- July '18}{Prof.\ Yao Wang}%chktex 8
    \item Researched \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02464}{\textbf{differentiable plasticity}} for \textbf{domain transfer} in images using Convolutional Neural Networks.
    \item Improved efficiency in the temporal update rule for the Hebbian weights for convolutional layers.
    \iffull{\item Tested various ResNet-based architectures on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.}
    \item Improved accuracy\iffull{ for smaller models} using plasticity, when adapting models pre-trained on\ifsingle{ the} SVHN\ifsingle{ dataset} for MNIST.\@
\end{project}

\item \begin{project}{Intern, Machine Learning Team, NYC Office of IIT Kanpur}{May -- July, 2017 \& 2018}{Prof.\ Manindra Agrawal}%chktex 8
    \item Developed an \textbf{online} text clustering model using a \href{https://github.com/cloudwalkio/ddbscan}{fully-online modification} of the DBSCAN algorithm.
    \item Implemented an \textbf{online} document vectorisation model using \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4053}{Distributed Memory paragraph vectors}.
    \item Developed a \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781}{Word2Vec} model to identify duplicate documents using \href{http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kusnerb15.html}{Word Mover's Distance} on word vectors.
